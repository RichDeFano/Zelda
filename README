 Contains an overworld, and 8 dungeons that as of now only contain a single room. This room holds the item(s) gained from 
 that dungeon. All character movement, items, and skills are mostly complete(minus interactions with some enemies etc). There are many 
 objects scattered through the overworld that are not in their final locations, and just used for testing(such as boomerang upgrades
 or magic upgrades)
 Controls: Z,X,C,V are your Action(Blue), Weapon(Green), and Item(Yellow) buttons. Arrow keys to move.
